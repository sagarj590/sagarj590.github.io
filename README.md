# My Neighborhood Map
## About the Project
- This is the Udacity's final project called named Neighborhood Map. It is intended as a challenge to put together a website from various APIs. This includes making function calls to Google Maps and other location-based third party services services like Foursquare API which loads asynchronously. 

- In this project I have included  a list of my favorite restaurants and coffee shops in Pune City, India.

- The app allows you to filter the list down as you type. In return, it displays the locations on the map and markers bounce when clicked.

- The Foursquare API gives us information regarding the likes and ratings of the venue.

- The App is responsive by use of media queries, i.e. resizes according to screen sizes and can work on PC's, mobile devices, and tablets too. 

- Knockout JS allows the app to be organized in MVVM pattern. 

## How To Use
1. Click on [Neighborhood Map](https://sagarj590.github.io) to try it out.
2. Click on any of the places on the map/list for more information about ratings and likes.
3. You can filter out places by typing in the search box to make them easier to spot.
4. You can scroll up and down for zooming in and out of the map.

## How to run the app locally
1. First download the project Zip file or clone the Repository.
2. Open the `index.html` in your browser.
3. Click on the markers or list which displays the `infoWindow` about likes and ratings about the venue.
4. You need to be connected to the internet, only then Foursquare data will be displayed.
